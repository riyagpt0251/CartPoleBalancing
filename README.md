## 🧠 Algorithm Overview

### Q-Learning Update Rule
The Q-value is updated using the following equation:

![Q-Learning Equation](https://github.com/yourusername/cartpole-qlearning/raw/main/assets/q_learning_equation.png)

### State Discretization
The continuous state space is discretized into buckets for efficient learning:
```python
def discretize_state(state):
    discretized = []
    for i in range(len(state)):
        scale = (state[i] + abs(env.observation_space.low[i])) / (env.observation_space.high[i] - env.observation_space.low[i])
        discretized.append(min(num_buckets[i]-1, max(0, int((num_buckets[i]-1)*scale))))
    return tuple(discretized)
```
